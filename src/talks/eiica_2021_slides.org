* Introduction: Autopoietic Systems (AS)

In our previous  work, we established the foundations for  the idea of
an Autopoietic System (AS).

Our model of an AS is  a system produced by consistent processes (e.g.
a  Turing   Machine),  giving  rise  to   an  emergent,  inconsistent,
open-ended environment.

#+reveal: split

Such environment  has a property  of completeness, and  its autonomous
processes    would    lead    to    bifurcations/contradictions    and
self-organization  through paradoxical  actions,  possibly leading  to
new, emerging consistent processes adrift in said environment.

This  leads to  an  idea closely  resembling that  of  a /Strange  Loop/
(HOFSTADTER, 1979).

* Objective of this work

We aim to  continue our previous work, by pointing  two impediments to
computational and logico-mathematical modelling  of an AS, and present
possible  solutions   to  those  impediments  which   may  impact  the
development of models for AS in general.

** Specific objectives

1. Present  the problem of a  lack of proper criteria  for identifying
   individuals in an AS;
2.  Present the  problem  of algebraic  modelling  of an  inconsistent
   system which is the basis for the AS;
3. Point  the direction  for potential solution  of these  problems: a
   criteria  of  individuality  and  a  way  to  handle  inconsistency
   algebraically.

* Individuation as a tool for AS recognition

Agents   as   fluid   framings    of   actions   in   an   autopoietic
environment. Agents can also be understood as individuals.

This   can  be   very   abstract,  and   may   demand  analogies   for
comprehension.

#+reveal: split

Humans  tend  to seek  examples  of  agents and  environments  through
antropomorphization and examples in biology.

Furthermore,  experimentation  and analysis  tend  to  begin with  the
agents  and, from  there,  we analyze  lexical  convergence and  other
factors.

#+reveal: split

We  should  step back  and  talk  about how  agents  may  arise in  an
autopoietic context.

#+reveal: split

We understand that

1. An AS demands a proper environment, as described in previous works;
2. Individuation is a criterion for identifying an AS.

** Individuation as a tool for modelling

It is imperative  to seek more precise tools for  recognition of those
"framings" of actions -- the agents (here, individuals in an AS).

Biological  and   antropomorphical  analogies  are  desired   but  may
contaminate the conclusion of whether a system is autopoietic or not.

#+reveal: split

It  is possible  to  develop  more precise  tools  for recognition  of
enactive agents in an open-ended environment, using information theory
as basis.

** Individuality from an Information Theory perspective

# Foram realizadas experimentações com processos estocásticos

/(...) individuals are  aggregates that  "propagate" information  from the
past  to the  future and  have temporal  integrity (...)/  (KRAKAUER /et
al./, 2020)

#+reveal: split

For that, we would seek fundamental properties of individuality, apart
from seeking properties derived from individuality.

#+reveal: split

Krakauer /et al./ (2020) propose criteria defining individuality:

- Individuality  is  a  continuous  factor, like  a  grade,  for  each
  process;
- Individuality may emerge at any level of an organization;
- Individuality may be nested.

#+reveal: split

These  considerations  remove  a  dichotomy  of  a  process  being  an
individual or  not, and relate to  the enactive ideas of  coupling and
natural drift.

Individuation  analysis would  then seem  like a  lens; adjusting  the
lens's focus and direction would  also impact on observed individuals,
and  how  "individual"   they  are,  but  not  on   the  criteria  for
individuality.

* Paraconsistency on formal descriptions of an AS

An AS  is composed  of potentially  consistent individuals  arisen and
adrift on an inconsistent context.

Modelling this  kind of situation (computationally  and algebraically)
becomes inevitable at some point.

#+reveal: split

Since   the  context   harbors  contradictions,   formalization  seems
incompatible due to the principle of explosion; a contradictory system
leads to uselessness.

#+reveal: split

However, in  paraconsistent systems,  the principle of  explosion does
not hold (CIUCIURA, 2020).

#+reveal: split

It is  possible to  formalize a system  where paradoxes  are partially
tolerated.

Ciuciura  (2020) shows  the usage  of a  /gently paraconsistent/  logic,
where a law  of "gentle explosion" is added  to positive propositional
calculi.

#+reveal: split

In /gently paraconsistent/  logic, the principle of  explosion holds if,
and only if:

\begin{equation*}
A \rightarrow (\lnot A \rightarrow (\lnot\lnot A \rightarrow B))
\end{equation*}

#+reveal: split

This   kind  of   reasoning  approaches   inductive  logic,   allowing
contradictions such as  $A \land \lnot A$, which lead  to explosion if
and only if the (now not-excluded) middle is proven true.

This could be a proper  framework for expressing consistent logic from
theorems  that  can  handle  contradictions from  the  perspective  of
classical logic.

* Conclusion

As future  perspectives, we  aim to  develop computational  models and
algebraic representations  for Autopoietic  Systems by  leveraging the
criteria of individuality from  the information theory perspective and
paraconsistent logic.
