The  following  are  games  I  developed from  scratch  for  the  PlayStation  1
console. These games were built with the  purpose of study and fun, but are also
great ways  to study legacy  hardware and  how to properly  leverage programming
skills on limited situations.

These games  are either on =.ISO=  or =.CHD= format.   They can be played  on an
emulator such as DuckStation or =pcsx-redux=. However, I've taken extra measures
to ensure that it  is run on actual real hardware -- these  demos were tested on
a modded SCPH-5501, burned on high quality media.

*NOTE:*  Links for  playing games  online use  Emulator.js and  therefore run  on
=pcsx-ReARMed=, so you might find some weird problems e.g. audio not playing. If
you wish to play these games with no problems, consider using a proper emulator.

* SONIC THE HEDGEHOG XA

SONIC THE  HEDGEHOG XA  -- formerly  known as  =engine-psx= --  is, as  the name
suggests, a study on building a 2D platformer game heavily inspired on Sonic The
Hedgehog. Given  its premise, it  is not  wrong to assume  that the best  way to
create something  that resembles classic  Sonic from  Sega Genesis era  is... to
build a Sonic  fan-game.

The name comes from the fact that  it uses level music with CD-XA format instead
of CD-DA (Red Book audio), and also  to somewhat resemble Sonic CD, which is its
main source of inspiration.

This game is also built using PSn00bSDK by Lameguy64 instead of Psy-Q.

*NOTE:*  This game  has *no  audio  when playing  online*. This  is an  emulator
limitation, so if you wish to have  the full experience, you'll have to download
the .CHD and run it on an emulator.
