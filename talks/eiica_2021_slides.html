<h2 id="org9c9cec2">Introduction: Autopoietic Systems (AS)</h2>
<p>
In our previous  work, we established the foundations for  the idea of
an Autopoietic System (AS).
</p>

<p>
Our model of an AS is  a system produced by consistent processes (e.g.
a  Turing   Machine),  giving  rise  to   an  emergent,  inconsistent,
open-ended environment.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9c9cec2-split">

<p>
Such environment  has a property  of completeness, and  its autonomous
processes    would    lead    to    bifurcations/contradictions    and
self-organization  through paradoxical  actions,  possibly leading  to
new, emerging consistent processes adrift in said environment.
</p>

<p>
This  leads to  an  idea closely  resembling that  of  a <i>Strange  Loop</i>
(HOFSTADTER, 1979).

<h2 id="orgc6f0bec">Objective of this work</h2>
<p>
We aim to  continue our previous work, by pointing  two impediments to
computational and logico-mathematical modelling  of an AS, and present
possible  solutions   to  those  impediments  which   may  impact  the
development of models for AS in general.
</p>

<h3 id="org68397a0">Specific objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Present  the problem of a  lack of proper criteria  for identifying
individuals in an AS;</li>
<li>Present the  problem  of algebraic  modelling  of an  inconsistent
system which is the basis for the AS;</li>
<li>Point  the direction  for potential solution  of these  problems: a
criteria  of  individuality  and  a  way  to  handle  inconsistency
algebraically.</li>

<h2 id="org9e1de02">Individuation as a tool for AS recognition</h2>
<p>
Agents   as   fluid   framings    of   actions   in   an   autopoietic
environment. Agents can also be understood as individuals.
</p>

<p>
This   can  be   very   abstract,  and   may   demand  analogies   for
comprehension.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9e1de02-split">

<p>
Humans  tend  to seek  examples  of  agents and  environments  through
antropomorphization and examples in biology.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore,  experimentation  and analysis  tend  to  begin with  the
agents  and, from  there,  we analyze  lexical  convergence and  other
factors.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9e1de02-split">

<p>
We  should  step back  and  talk  about how  agents  may  arise in  an
autopoietic context.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9e1de02-split">

<p>
We understand that
</p>

<ol>
<li>An AS demands a proper environment, as described in previous works;</li>
<li>Individuation is a criterion for identifying an AS.</li>

</ol>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1d6b097">
<h3 id="org1d6b097">Individuation as a tool for modelling</h3>
<p>
It is imperative  to seek more precise tools for  recognition of those
"framings" of actions &#x2013; the agents (here, individuals in an AS).
</p>

<p>
Biological  and   antropomorphical  analogies  are  desired   but  may
contaminate the conclusion of whether a system is autopoietic or not.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org1d6b097-split">

<p>
It  is possible  to  develop  more precise  tools  for recognition  of
enactive agents in an open-ended environment, using information theory
as basis.

<h3 id="orgd247366">Individuality from an Information Theory perspective</h3>

<p>
<i>(&#x2026;) individuals are  aggregates that  "propagate" information  from the
past  to the  future and  have temporal  integrity (&#x2026;)</i>  (KRAKAUER <i>et
al.</i>, 2020)

<p>
For that, we would seek fundamental properties of individuality, apart
from seeking properties derived from individuality.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgd247366-split">

<p>
Krakauer <i>et al.</i> (2020) propose criteria defining individuality:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Individuality  is  a  continuous  factor, like  a  grade,  for  each
process;</li>
<li>Individuality may emerge at any level of an organization;</li>
<li>Individuality may be nested.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgd247366-split">

<p>
These  considerations  remove  a  dichotomy  of  a  process  being  an
individual or  not, and relate to  the enactive ideas of  coupling and
natural drift.
</p>

<p>
Individuation  analysis would  then seem  like a  lens; adjusting  the
lens's focus and direction would  also impact on observed individuals,
and  how  "individual"   they  are,  but  not  on   the  criteria  for
individuality.

<h2 id="org0c5e3f1">Paraconsistency on formal descriptions of an AS</h2>
<p>
An AS  is composed  of potentially  consistent individuals  arisen and
adrift on an inconsistent context.
</p>

<p>
Modelling this  kind of situation (computationally  and algebraically)
becomes inevitable at some point.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0c5e3f1-split">

<p>
Since   the  context   harbors  contradictions,   formalization  seems
incompatible due to the principle of explosion; a contradictory system
leads to uselessness.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0c5e3f1-split">

<p>
However, in  paraconsistent systems,  the principle of  explosion does
not hold (CIUCIURA, 2020).
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0c5e3f1-split">

<p>
It is  possible to  formalize a system  where paradoxes  are partially
tolerated.
</p>

<p>
Ciuciura  (2020) shows  the usage  of a  <i>gently paraconsistent</i>  logic,
where a law  of "gentle explosion" is added  to positive propositional
calculi.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0c5e3f1-split">

<p>
In <i>gently paraconsistent</i>  logic, the principle of  explosion holds if,
and only if:
</p>

<div>
\begin{equation*}
A \rightarrow (\lnot A \rightarrow (\lnot\lnot A \rightarrow B))
\end{equation*}

</div>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0c5e3f1-split">

<p>
This   kind  of   reasoning  approaches   inductive  logic,   allowing
contradictions such as  \(A \land \lnot A\), which lead  to explosion if
and only if the (now not-excluded) middle is proven true.
</p>

<p>
This could be a proper  framework for expressing consistent logic from
theorems  that  can  handle  contradictions from  the  perspective  of
classical logic.

<h2 id="orga73b36f">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
As future  perspectives, we  aim to  develop computational  models and
algebraic representations  for Autopoietic  Systems by  leveraging the
criteria of individuality from  the information theory perspective and
paraconsistent logic.
