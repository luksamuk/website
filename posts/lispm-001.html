<h2 id="org83a97f0">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org83a97f0">
<p>
I am often fascinated by old tech.
</p>

<p>
While I do not have the experience nor the expertise on the subject, in the last
months, some very specific stuff has caught my eye, and those are the Lisp
Machines.
</p>

<p>
I've been using Common Lisp for about three years and a half and, though
only now I began to make cool stuff using the language, the fact that it is not
very used bothers me a lot. I mean, of course, it is not something as welcoming
in terms of first impression. Lisp is known for its overwhelming parentheses,
which often hide the true power of the language.
</p>

<p>
But this bad first impression cloaks the possibilities  of a mature
language such as Common Lisp, of Lisps in general, and of specialized
hardware and systems, built to ensure performance on Lisp execution.
</p>

<p>
On this post, I try to present very early ideas in a project of a new, modern
Lisp Machine of sorts; one which might have the potential to make true hackers
feel at home with the idea of running a highly customizable, but also
efficient Unix-like system built to run Lisp on specialized, modern hardware.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0bc4018" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0bc4018">Lisp Machines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0bc4018">
<p>
Lisp Machines were computers specially designed to run Lisp code efficiently.
This is justified by the way the language works: Lisp stands for
"List Processor". Since Lisps stand over heavy usage of list data structures,
it is only natural that someone would want fine-tuned hardware to deal with
those, so these machines carefully reduced execution costs with specific
hardware, CPU instructions, and specific memory management.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine">Lisp Machines</a> rose inside the MIT AI labs, which gave birth to its first
forms, only to pretty much die after the fall of Symbolics, the company bred
from the same labs, which produced them commercially, leaving a legacy and
orphaned lispers who are still waiting for Lisp Machines to rise once again.
The original Lisp Machines, as I was told, were built using processors with
reduced instruction sets (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>), and a very specific way to manage memory.
</p>

<p>
This whole story bothered me to the point which I though I should try building
one, from scratch, since RISC processors seem to be rising once again (a little
more on that later in this post). It is old stuff, but it seems interesting,
given that it pretty much operates different than the way modern computers do.
But it also needed to be something that I would be able to use, and enjoy using.
And it might even serve as base for next projects, which I will explain in the
following paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
However, this "Lisp Machine" I intend to build is not the first example of
what a fully-functional computer running an OS built using Lisp in the present
days could be.
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/09/23/old-lisp-languaged-used-for-new-raspberry-pi-os/">Lukas F. Hartmann already built something like this for the Raspberry Pi 2</a>,
pretty much in the model which I want to follow: the resulting experiment is
a board, attached to a custom-made keyboard. Interim OS (as the operational
system is called) is a full-fledged Lisp system, running its own dialect
(do not confuse with the recent <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/interim">Interim Lisp</a>, which is a low-level Lisp with
compile-time memory management, much like Rust language). This OS also has
the interesting aspect of having been inspired by <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/">Plan 9</a>, the operational
system which is the true spiritual successor to the original Unix.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org71812f2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org71812f2">Hardware optimizations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71812f2">
<p>
My main concern is about the kind of hardware-level optimizations that
such an operational system, built using Lisp, might require. Therefore, I have
decided that I should go ahead and try building custom instructions atop a
flexible architecture which would allow me to do so. And this is where the plain
new RISC-V architecture comes in &#x2013; praised by media, open, hackable, exactly
what I want. And this is what would set it apart: While Interim OS is an awesome
project, it is built for ARM processors, therefore it is stuck to the ARM
instruction set. With RISC-V, not only could those instructions be extended, but
it would also be didatic enough so that hackers with sufficient knowledge could
mess with.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7666631" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7666631">System architecture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7666631">
<p>
For the user experience, my intention is to create a Unix-like
environment, though I do not intend to follow POSIX, not even remotely. The user
would be presented with what seems to be a Unix environment, mimicking Plan 9 as
best as possible &#x2013; this does not only mean good old Unix experience, but also
possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P_(protocol)">9p integration</a>, so that building clusters could also be possible with
ease.
</p>

<p>
The system, of course, would also have openness and simplicity in its code as
fundaments. Files can be precompiled (though I still need to give it careful
thinking, since I do not want to replicate the old MIT LispM's and <a href="https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano">Mezzano</a>'s
mistake of taking hours to boot for the first time &#x2013; the former one requiring
such big time every day; this goal also implies simplicity on kernel development
itself), though hacking them should be easy: if you want to change anything,
just go ahead and change the source code, then recompile the file, or even only
the form. This would allow not only the
experience of live debugging while running the code (given that I also implement
something as powerful as Common Lisp's conditions and <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a>'s debugger), but
would also make possible to create a fun environment in which I may bootstrap
the whole system while I'm running it! Just imagine developing a kernel atop
itself.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking about implementing these using some kind of layer. The very
base of the system would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">implemented in Forth</a>, which could be implemented
directly using RISC-V assembly, with minimal extra words for its dictionary,
which harness the power of the custom processor instructions that are required
for the Lisp Machine. From Forth, we may then bootstrap a basic Lisp
interpreter; and from the interpreter, we bootstrap the rest of the system.
I am not entirely sure what to make of the dialect which should be implemented
itself, but I'm almost certain that it will be a subset of Common Lisp, which
I believe is the descendant of the dialects used on old Lisp Machines. I am not
naive enough to think that I will be able to implement Common Lisp on this
system with so much to do already, but the intention is to leave the dialect
itself somewhat open, so the features of Common Lisp may be slowly implemented
as needed.
</p>

<p>
I'm also thinking carefully on what to do about concurrency on this new system.
Some folks once told me that the problem with praised systems languages such as
C and C++ is that they still make you pretend that you're programming on a
machine which works like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>, something that is not justifiable given the
current state of industry. While I like C and C++, I cannot find a
counter-argument, therefore it is probably important that I take it seriously
from the beginning of system development, even though the first implementation
might be built atop a 1-core RISC-V processor. For that reason, I am carefully
looking into the topic of coroutines, and this might even imply a scheduler for
the system to make those work, and possibly take advantage of the processor
as much as it can, according to its number of cores.
</p>

<h2 id="orge9cc0fc">Extensibility and hackability</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9cc0fc">
<p>
Another interesting thing which I'm giving a lot of thought is the ability to
change dialects and paradigms in a per-app basis. Of course there would be a
common interface for inter-application communication, but imagine a single
directive which, when evaluated, changes the interpreter only for that
application so you can write it in, say, Clojure, for example (minus all the
Java bloat, of course!). This might even be a way to enforce functional
principles such as immutability to enhance performance even more on certain
situations.
</p>

<p>
We would also need a basic text editor in order for all of this to happen.
For that, the intention is to implement a small variation of Emacs or Zmacs
editors, so that coding is made simpler. Scripting language would need to be the
system's own dialect, although maybe Emacs Lisp support could be implemented
using the idea from the last paragraph.

<h2 id="orge167f3e">Graphical interface</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge167f3e">
<p>
Finally, as for GUI applications, Common Lisp has the fantastic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Interface_Manager">CLIM</a>, which is
very underrated and has a lot of good principles. CLIM could be implemented
using the system's dialect, and then GUI applications could be created using it,
much like someone would do with Qt on any platform, for example.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7d5bcd5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7d5bcd5">Internet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7d5bcd5">
<p>
I've been discussing a lot with friends about the possibility of
"web" pages built using S-expressions instead of HTML itself. This would
probably be a huge break in the way a browser works, however this might be just
perfect for a system running Lisp as its main language, since the page itself is
already arranged as a tree. It would also be interesting to allow that same idea
of changing dialects for a scripting language on those pages, however I would
opt to sandbox Lisp web scripts like this so they cannot manipulate many things,
while also using the system interpreter itself to optimize the execution of said
scripts. With such a feature, the webpages are but lists of lists, and scripts
could be external files written in Scheme, for example, or even lambdas attached
directly into the document tree.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting feature would be to support a dialect of WebAssembly of
sorts which could compile to machine code directly, just like a Lisp file
would. This way, the script's safety could be enforced before compilation, and
then the page script could take full advantage of the system's native
performance.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb916ba8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb916ba8">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb916ba8">
<p>
Those are ideas for something that has proven difficult to do,
specially given the fact that I lack a lot of experience and knowledge in most
of the things I have described above. Most of the difficult would be on actually
learning the RISC-V low-level stuff to even begin building such a system; and
then, implementing Forth using nothing but assembly, which will also be a pain;
then finally, implementing Lisp atop Forth, which might also be a huge problem.
Plus, the whole system and kernel is another big effort that will take much more
time, and having a minimal environment for me to have fun bootstrapping the
system as suggested (which would be crucial so I don't get bored) would also
require that Emacs/Zmacs clone to work well.
</p>

<p>
This is a huge project comprised, right now, mostly of ideas I've been maturing
on the last months, and discussing with friends over the internet. I'm already
collecting books and articles on all of those subjects to read in my free time,
but I know it is gonna take time. However, it would be really nice to see this
stuff working, specially if the community could make good use of it.
